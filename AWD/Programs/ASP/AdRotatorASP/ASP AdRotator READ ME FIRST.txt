ASP AdRotator Component


The ASP AdRotator component creates an AdRotator object that displays a different image each time a user enters or refreshes a page. A text file includes information about the images.

Note: The AdRotator does not work with Internet Information Server 7 (IIS7). 

Solution is there in asp file :)


advertisement txt file will have following entries:

In the first line we must include the character  "*", and starting in second line, each four lines we will include information related to one ad (first ad in red, second ad in blue). 
Information related to each ad must be write in four lines as shown above. Ad related information will be introduced in the order used in the example:

1st line: location of imagen2nd line: click url3rd line: defauld text4th line: relative frecuency for this ad

A conventional link will be like this: 
    <A HREF="http://www.domain1.com"><IMG SRC="/image1.gif"  ALT="Visit domain1.com"></A>
